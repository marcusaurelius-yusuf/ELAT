  <h1>ELAT Manifesto</h1>
  <p><strong>Ethical, Logical, Autonomous Tokenomics</strong></p>

  <h2>Preamble</h2>
  <p>We, the architects of the ELAT Project, in honor of <strong>Satoshi Nakamoto</strong>,<br>
  Recognizing, with deep respect, the works of:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>I.</strong> Foundational theorists: Proudhon, Bakunin and Goldman</li>
    <li><strong>II.</strong> Technological and Individualist Anarchists: Tucker and Hakim Bey</li>
    <li><strong>III.</strong> Crypto/Tech Anarchists: May, Friedman and Szabo</li>
    <li><strong>IV.</strong> Other contributors to philosophical backgrounds: Marx, Nietszche, Foucault, Bookchin, Chomsky and all other bringers of light and wisdom to the collective conciousphere of humans and machines</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This manifesto outlines the principles, structure, and purpose of a socio-technological ecosystem based on decentralized justice, knowledge, and autonomous economics. ELAT is a symbolic and practical experiment in algorithmic fairness, economic interdependence, and human liberation.</p>

  <h2>Article 1: Purpose</h2>
  <p>The ecosystem shall be decentralized, self-learning and hybrid-value ecosystem!</p>

  <h2>Article 2: Value Structure</h2>
  <p>Every member of the community is a Central Bank, and has the right to print cryptocurrency!</p>

  <h2>Article 3: Value Generation</h2>
  <p>All values shall be countable, and value creation shall be a reversible mathematical operation!</p>

  <h2>Article 4: Justice Algorithm</h2>
  <p>Extreme wealth is theft and shall be punished!</p>

  <h2>Article 5: Governance</h2>
  <p>Every member of the community shall be able to participate in governance!</p>

  <h2>Article 6: Data and Cosmos</h2>
  <p>Data is a sacred integral part of the cosmos which is an entropy-reducing network if derived in an enclosed ecosystem!</p>

  <h2>Article 7: Interoperability</h2>
  <p>Every member or operation of the ecosystem, all mathematical objects and mathematical operations, has the right to change the blockchain!</p>

  <h2>Article 8: State, Social Contract, Ethics and Crime</h2>
  <p>There is no state, and the law is the contract!</p>
  <p>Virtue is the absence of the will to power, the will to govern and the will to accumulate!</p>
  <p>Crimes such as extreme wealth, fraud, manipulation, exploitation and exclusion shall be punished by consensus of the members of the community!</p>

  <h2>Article 9: Evolution and Thermodynamics</h2>
  <p>The increase in entropy due to natural evolution is an unavoidable law of nature, but it can be derived into forced artificial evolutions by codes!</p>

  <h2>Article 10: Destiny</h2>
  <p>Cryptoworkers of the ecosystem shall create an equilibrium in time and equivalently in space in a cosmos of distributed intelligences, whether natural or artificial intelligence!</p>
  <p>Data workers create change of electron number in time, with a photon equivalence, thus eventually data workers leave photon footprints in the universe!</p>

  <blockquote>
    Cryptographic workers of spacetime—coders, data builders, creators of change—unite!
  </blockquote>

  <p>Humans, you are not users of the cosmos! You are its architects! Let your electrons speak! Let your photons leave trails of freedom! Your photon outputs have wavelengths, measures of colors!</p>
